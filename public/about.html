<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Daryl Heffernan, an aspiring web developer. I'm passionate about building things, and for years, that meant welding metal into structures that 
could withstand the rigors of being in service. Either pipeline, piping system, or building, but recently, I've discovered a new love for building in the digital world.</p>

<p>My journey into web development and coding began with a simple curiosity. I wanted to understand how the websites I used
every day were created. That curiosity quickly turned into a full-fledged obsession. I spent countless hours teaching
myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I was hooked.</p>

<p>The more I learned, the more I realized how much my welding background had prepared me for this new path. Both welding
and coding require problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to create something from nothing. The
only difference is the tools I use.</p>

<p>Now, I'm excited to combine my two passions and forge a new career as a web developer. I'm eager to learn from
experienced professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, and use my skills to create beautiful, functional
websites that make a real impact.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me tinkering with my welding projects, exploring the outdoors, or spending
time with my family and friends. I'm a lifelong learner, always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow.</p>
