<h1>The Best Movies According To Daryl</h1>

<h2>Possibly My Top 3 Of ALL Time!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Friday the 13th - 1980</h3>
<p>Jason Voorhees is the ultimate slasher villain, and on Friday the 13th, at Camp Crystal Lake, it all began. The film's twist ending is still a shocker, and the kills are surprisingly creative. It's a must-watch for any horror fan.</p>
<h3>Alien - 1979</h3>
<p>Alien was the first film that made me fall in love with sci-fi horror. It's a perfect storm of brilliant
direction, incredible visuals, a haunting score, and a cast that feels like real people trapped in a nightmare. It's been a favourite since!</p>
<h3>HellRaiser - 1987</h3>
<p>Pinhead, and Clive Barker are horror icons for a reason. PinHead is terrifying, eloquent, and completely captivating. Hellraiser's exploration of desire and suffering is thought-provoking, and the puzzle box is a brilliant storytelling device. It was the first time the scares came with a side of philosophy.</p>
